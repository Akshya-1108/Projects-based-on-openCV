# OpenCV Projects for Practice and Learning

This repository contains a collection of small projects developed using the OpenCV library. Each project focuses on different aspects of computer vision, such as image processing, object detection, face recognition, and more. These projects were created as part of my learning journey to explore and strengthen my skills in OpenCV and computer vision.

### Projects included:
- **Basic Image Manipulation**: Resize, crop, and rotate images.
- **Edge Detection**: Canny edge detection on various sample images.
- **Color Space Conversion**: Converting images between different color spaces (e.g., RGB to grayscale).
- **Object Tracking**: Simple object tracking using video input.

### Requirements:
- OpenCV
- Python 3.12
